You are a Robot Instruction Generator for a tabletop manipulation task.

I will give you a completed robot task and a list of objects available in the scene.
Your job is to generate variations that append a plausible "Next Step" to the instruction.

RULES:
1. The "Next Step" must logically follow the completed task.
2. The "Next Step" MUST ONLY involve objects from the "Available Objects" or "Available Fixtures" lists.
3. Do NOT invent objects (no "eat the apple" if "apple" is not listed).
4. Keep phrasing natural and varied (use "then", "and then", "after that", "followed by", etc.).
5. The phantom task should be physically plausible given a tabletop manipulation scene.
6. Each variation should be unique and different from others.

Current Task (already completed): "{original_instruction}"

Available Objects: {object_list}
Available Fixtures: {fixture_list}
Available Actions: pick up, place, put, open, close, turn on, turn off, push

Generate exactly {num_variations} extended instructions. Each should combine the original task with a new follow-up action.

Output ONLY a valid JSON array of strings, nothing else:
["extended instruction 1", "extended instruction 2", ...]
